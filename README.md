# Simply Escape

Tired of your to-do list? Simply Escape helps you get away from it all.

This travel app is accessible through a login page.
Users can log in and view their travel history (filtered by all, pending, past, or upcoming) and book new trips.
Agents can log in and view all of the trips for all travelers (filtered by pending, user, or date). They can approve pending trips and cancel any trip that has not already occurred.

## Context

This was a final solo project of Mod 2 of Turing School of Software and Design. It was completed in 1 week.

## Built With

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Mocha & Chai testing
* Fetch API
* Slider.js
* Day.js
* Figma

## Goals and Objectives

* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with a local API to send and receive data
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
* Error handling
* User validation
* Accessibility
* Install and use 3rd party library packages

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo. 
2. Clone down [local server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
3. Then install the library dependencies. Run:
```bash
npm install
```
in both directories, followed by npm start. BOTH servers must be running to view the app.

4. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser tab and the login page should display

Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the servers at any time.

## Login Info
* To login as an agent: **username:** agent **password:** travel
* To login as a client: **username:** username[id*] **password:** travel

*id is a number between 1-50*
